# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native renders an empty list even after a successful API call. The data is fetched correctly, but the FlatList doesn't update.

## Bug Description
The application fetches data from an API endpoint.  The API call is successful, and the data is logged to the console.  However, the FlatList component remains empty. The issue is related to how the state is updated in response to the fetched data.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`).
4. Observe that the FlatList remains empty despite successful API data retrieval.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the data is properly updated in the component's state. This typically involves using `useEffect` with the correct dependencies and handling asynchronous operations appropriately.  Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for a corrected implementation.
